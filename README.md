# Point to Point
Point to Point is a classic picture memory card game with a twist.
As the players match the pictures of famous destinations in Eretz Yisrael with their names, they learn more about the destination and where they can find it on the map.
A description of the game and its software requirements are provided below.

## The game
The player is presented with two grids, each filling a third of the game board.  Each grid is filled with 8 cards.  The last third of the game board is a map of Israel. Clicking on the cards in the top grid displays the name and image of a famous destination in Eretz Yisrael.  Clicking on the bottom grid displays the name of the destination.  As the player matches each set of picture and name, the cards disappear from the game board.  At the end of the game, the gameboard shows a map of Israel with all the destination points.

**The full spec for the game is in the repo.**
